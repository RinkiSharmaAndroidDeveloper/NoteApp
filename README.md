# NoteApp


It is about Clean Architecture and SOLID principles with Android development and Kotlin.
Basically this is an app about creating notes and save them in local database of your mobile,using the latest technologies and libraries.

The purpose of this app is to give you a practical example of how to use Clean architecture, all while building a simple example app.



 Learning about:

Clean Architecture

Components and layers

SOLID principles

MVVM

Applying Clean architecture in an example app

Jetpack navigation

Room database

Dependency Injection

All of these topics are necessary to have a well rounded, scalable, robust and maintainable application. So we not only need to understand how they work, but also how they are implemented in practice and how they relate to each other. In this course we will go line by line, explain why we need it and what it does, so that you have a clear understanding of the complete process of building a modern Android app.

If you want to become an expert Android Developer, you need to know how to structure and build your applications correctly
